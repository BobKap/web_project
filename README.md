# CodeLou_FrontEnd

## Description
```
    My goal was to do more than only meet the project requirements. I sought to start a project that when completed during the "back-end" section of Code Louisville, would show my ability to present the required material in a visually pleasing manner, and to show my capability to seek solutions on my own when necessary.

1. .nav-link  Styles the navigation links.
